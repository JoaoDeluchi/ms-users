# Prerequisites

## Docker installed (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

# Building the Docker Image

## Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

## Build the Docker image using the following command:

### Bash
#### docker build -t zpe-user-management-api .

# Running the API in a Docker Container
## Start the API in a detached mode using the following command:

### Bash
#### docker run -d -p 8080:8080 zpe-user-management-api
###### -d runs the container in detached mode, allowing the terminal to prompt for further commands.
###### -p 8080:8080 maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 8080 inside the container. This allows you to access the API running in the container from your browser at http://localhost:8080. You can adjust the port numbers if needed.
